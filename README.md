# Smart-Money

# Description

This app allows users to track their bank account deposits and withdrawals while traveling from anywhere around the world. Smart-Money is also able to work offline using a service worker just in case wherever you are does not have a great internet connection. We use MongoDB Atlas for the database storage and is deployed using Heroku.
